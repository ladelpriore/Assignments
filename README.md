# Block 6 Workshop: Grocery List
HTML and CSS files that display food photos, different categories of grocery items, and that list the different items.

# Grocery List Requirements
Your list needs to meet all the following requirements.

Incorporate the major HTML semantic tags.
Each category of grocery should be in some type of "section".
Sections should have background colors.
Section headers should have background colors.
The h1 text needs to be a different color.
Use three types of headings.
Include two types of lists.
Use the box model to add borders and spacing to each section.
Add two photos with space between them and other elements so they are nicely spaced away from the text element.
CSS must be incorporated using an external CSS file, internal in the head, and inline. You choose which CSS goes where.
Push to GitHub and upload your link for your submission.
